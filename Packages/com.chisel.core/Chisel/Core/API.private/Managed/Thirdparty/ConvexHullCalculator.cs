	// From: https://github.com/OskarSigvardsson/unity-quickhull

	// Modified for Chisel variable types with unnecessary features stripped.

	/// <summary>
	///   An implementation of the quickhull algorithm for generating 3d convex
	///   hulls.
	///
	///   The algorithm works like this: you start with an initial "seed" hull,
	///   that is just a simple tetrahedron made up of four points in the point
	///   cloud. This seed hull is then grown until it all the points in the
	///   point cloud is inside of it, at which point it will be the convex hull
	///   for the entire set.
	///
	///   All of the points in the point cloud is divided into two parts, the
	///   "open set" and the "closed set". The open set consists of all the
	///   points outside of the tetrahedron, and the closed set is all of the
	///   points inside the tetrahedron. After each iteration of the algorithm,
	///   the closed set gets bigger and the open set get smaller. When the open
	///   set is empty, the algorithm is finished.
	///
	///   Each point in the open set is assigned to a face that it lies outside
	///   of. To grow the hull, the point in the open set which is farthest from
	///   it's face is chosen. All faces which are facing that point (I call
	///   them "lit faces" in the code, because if you imagine the point as a
	///   point light, it's the set of points which would be lit by that point
	///   light) are removed, and a "horizon" of edges is found from where the
	///   faces were removed. From this horizon, new faces are constructed in a
	///   "cone" like fashion connecting the point to the edges.
	///
	///   To keep track of the faces, I use a struct for each face which
	///   contains the three vertices of the face in CCW order, as well as the
	///   three triangles which share an edge. I was considering doing a
	///   half-edge structure to store the mesh, but it's not needed. Using a
	///   struct for each face and neighbors simplify the algorithm and makes it
	///   easy to export it as a mesh.
	///
	///   The most subtle part of the algorithm is finding the horizon. In order
	///   to properly construct the cone so that all neighbors are kept
	///   consistent, you can do a depth-first search from the first lit face.
	///   If the depth-first search always proceeeds in a counter-clockwise
	///   fashion, it guarantees that the horizon will be found in a
	///   counter-clockwise order, which makes it easy to construct the cone of
	///   new faces.
	///
	///   A note: the code uses a right-handed coordinate system, where the
	///   cross-product uses the right-hand rule and the faces are in CCW order.
	///   At the end of the algorithm, the hull is exported in a Unity-friendly
	///   fashion, with a left-handed mesh.
