Notes:
- Chisel requires Unity 2020.2 or newer
- UX is still under development
- CSG algorithm is still under development
- It is *not yet* ready for production, but please feel free to try it out!

Known issues:
* Intersection vertices aren't yet merged between brushes, which can cause tiny gaps between polygons
* There are some cases where triangulation fails, possibly related to previous vertex merging issue
  (please collect failure cases so we can later verify we fixed them)
* Moving a brush using the inspector will not always update it's touching brushes
* Normal smoothing is not yet implemented

Packages overview:
* `com.chisel.core` Low-level API and functionality (based on DOTS technology)
* `com.chisel.editor` Unity Scene Editor functionality and API, tools and UI
* `com.chisel.components` Unity Monobehaviour runtime API (to allow for possible ECS replacement in future)
* `com.scene.handles.extensions` Custom scene handle extensions

The core technology is based on the algorithm explained in [this GDC 2020 talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqmg4gblreo)
